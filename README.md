# Forest Burning Simulation

This repository is a simulator designed to model and visualize forest fires using satellite images and region maps.

## Overview

The simulation demonstrates how a fire starts and spreads in a forest based on real satellite imagery and region data. Three main images are referenced:

1. **Original Satellite Image**:  
   The starting point of the study. This is a genuine satellite image of the region under analysis.

2. **Simulated Forest Map**:  
   An interpreted map that models the area using simplified color codes:
   - **Green**: Trees (healthy, unburned)
   - **Brown**: Bare soil (non-forested land)
   
3. **Initial Fire Simulation**:  
   Shows the area where the fire begins and how it propagates. The color codes are:
   - **Green**: Healthy trees
   - **Brown**: Bare soil
   - **Gray**: Burnt trees
   - **Orange**: Active fire area

## Color Legend

- **Green**: Unburned/healthy trees
- **Brown**: Soil/non-forested areas
- **Gray**: Burnt trees
- **Orange**: Fire

## Current Status

**This simulator is not yet highly accurate. Increasing its precision requires more time and collaboration with the community.**

## Purpose

This project is intended for educational and research purposes to visualize and model forest fires using satellite data and computational mapping. It helps illustrate the spread of fire, assess affected regions, and understand the transformation of forest areas during burning events.
